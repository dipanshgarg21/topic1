    <p>IoT applications are applications used to gain control/manage the hardware appliances without having to control
      them physically. These applications allow the user to control such appliances over WiFi or bluetooth using remote
      devices such as a smartphone. These applications are build using software tools of both back-end and front-end.
    </p>
    <p>Further, their main features consists of Realtime data moniroting, Simple interactable User Interface, hardware
      integration, responsiveness and error report notifications.</p>
    <p>Some of its examples include: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Smart home security system</li>
      <li> Smart evacuation system</li>
      <li> Health monitoring system</li>
      <li> Hospital or Restaurant Reservation system (Congestion avoiding system)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Smart building is a building in which there is use of multiple IoT devices/applications hence automating some of
      the processes and reducing human labour and other unnecessary processing such as switching air conditioner's
      temperature according to the environment's temperature or putting up a minor request etc. A smart building also
      eliminates the scope of human error which is usually produced and also collects environment data which also helps
      the staff/employees to analyse the problems with ease.</p>
    <p>Moreover, it also covers major safety concerns such as congestion avoidance, security and ventelation. Its main
      features include data collection/backup, motion detection, intruder/anti-theft alarms, contactless appliances etc.
    </p>
    <p>Some of it's usage scenarios include: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Security (Intruder detection)</li>
      <li>Congestion avoidance detection</li>
      <li>Air quality monitoring and ventilation</li>
      <li>Turning on and off appliances automatically based on its usage hence saving electricity.</li>
      <li>Contactless appliances</li>
    </ul>

    <p>A control interface is a user interface which is build on applications such as Python, HTML, CSS, .js etc. This
      interface is used for controlling/managing IoT devices. It is also used to get a realtime data monitoring and
      fault notifications.</p>
    <p>Its high level features consists of Realtime monitoring, Remote control, Mode switching, Device integration,
      Simple UI etc.</p>
    <p>Some of the examples for its users are:</p>
    <li>Fire departments</li>
    <li>Organizations (staff, employees, students)</li>
    <li>Personal users</li>
    <li>Logistical departments</li>
    <li>Restaurants and hotels.</li>
    <li>Technicians and security departments</li>
